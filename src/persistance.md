# Persistance

Actor persistence allows actors to save their internal state and message processing history. This is crucial for ensuring reliability and fault tolerance, enabling an actor to recover its state after a system restart or crash. By persisting state and potentially incoming messages, the actor can pick up exactly where it left off, maintaining consistency and durability.
