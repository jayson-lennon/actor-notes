# System Maintainability

In traditional architectures, adding new features often involves modifying existing codebases, potentially introducing regressions or unintended side effects. With the actor model, this process is significantly cleaner.  New functionality frequently translates into *adding new actors*.

Think of it like building with Lego bricks instead of sculpting a single block of clay. Want to add a new feature? Create an actor that encapsulates that feature's logic and connect it to existing actors via messages. This has several key benefits:

- **Isolation:** The new functionality is isolated within its own actor, minimizing the risk of impacting other parts of the system.  No need to fear widespread code changes or complex refactoring.
- **Clear Boundaries:** Actors clearly define boundaries of responsibility. Adding a feature means defining what that actor *does*, and how it interacts with others â€“ leading to better-defined interfaces and reduced coupling.
- **Testability:** Individual actors are much easier to test in isolation, as you can focus solely on their behavior without needing to mock or simulate complex interactions.

**Example:** Imagine a shopping cart system. Initially, you have actors for `Cart`, `ProductCatalog`, and `PaymentProcessor`. Now, you want to add a "Recommendation Engine." Instead of modifying the existing actors, you create a new `RecommendationEngine` actor that receives messages about items in the cart and sends back recommendations. This keeps the core logic clean and focused. The shopping cart and related functionality still run just as before (including their performance characteristics), but now there is new functionality that can provide recommendations.
