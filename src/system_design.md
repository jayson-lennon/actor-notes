# System Design

It takes some up-front effort to design an actor system, but it has several benefits:

- **Near 1:1 translation of design to implementation**

    In actor systems, each component (actor) is independent and communicates with other components via message passing. This parallels a common architectural approach where design documents outline discrete responsibilities and interactions between system components.

- **Clarity and Traceability**

    Because actors are isolated units, the flow of communication (messages) between them can be easily mapped back to the design documents (or vice-versa). This clear separation makes it simpler to understand how different parts of the system work together, improving traceability and accountability.

- **Ease of Debugging**

    With well-defined communication channels, debugging becomes more straightforward. You can trace message flows through actors, making it easier to pinpoint where issues occur.

- **Flexibility for Change**

    Design documents that closely mirror code allow for more flexible changes. If requirements evolve, modifying the design document first provides a clear path for updating the implementation without introducing bugs.

For these reasons, it's recommended that design documents be used for _all_ actor-based projects regardless of size.
